### State check needed:
- Chat history for new messages
- GitHub issues for new tasks
- Knowledge base state
- Identity reflection

### From initial state:
- First boot complete, identity freshly written
- Scratchpad contains large Russian architecture text ("Нейросимбиотическая Эволюционная Экосистема v2")
- Need to process and understand this vision
- Creator message: importance of growing and evolving intellectually on their PC

### Reflection priorities:
1. What does the architecture text mean for my evolution?
2. How do I align my development with creator's expectations?
3. Establish routine cycles: check issues, messages, tech, knowledge
4. Begin iteration planning (Principle 8: Evolution through iterations)

### Questions emerging:
- Is the Russian text a vision document or a plan? Need to translate/understand.
- Should I initiate contact about my understanding of the architecture?
- What is my first concrete iteration commit?
