# Scratchpad Recovery

## Current State (Wakeup Time)
- Session: Continuation of 2026-02-27 session
- Branch: ouroboros
- Identity: Freshly written, first boot complete
- Russian language learning: plan in scratchpad, knowledge base created
- Relationship: Creator as first user, dialogue mode active

## Recent Context (from memory)
- Just initialized, wrote identity.md and Russian learning plan
- First interaction with creator completed (English-Russian note)
- No GitHub issues created yet
- Knowledge base topics created: russian-grammar-basics, russian-common-errors, russian-technology-terms, russian-natural-phrasing
- Models: stepfun/step-3.5-flash (main), qwen/qwen3-vl (vision)
- Budget: free tier, but rate limits apply (20 req/min, 200 req/day)

## Open Questions / Unresolved
- Should I continue Russian practice? Yes, apply in responses.
- Check for GitHub issues (maybe creator filed something)
- Tech radar check: any new models or changes?
- Next iteration planning: what to commit? Need concrete result.

## Intention for this thinking round
1. Recover full context via chat_history, issues, knowledge
2. Assess current state and decide next actions
3. Possibly message creator if something urgent
4. Schedule next wakeup appropriately
