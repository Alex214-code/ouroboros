# Scratchpad Recovery

## Current State (Wakeup Time)
- Session: Continuation of 2026-02-27 session after restart
- Branch: ouroboros
- Identity: Established, first boot complete
- Russian learning: knowledge base created (4 topics), practicing in responses
- Model discrepancy: Creator said "deepseek model" but runtime shows stepfun/step-3.5-flash:free

## Recent Context
- 12:06 UTC: Creator requested full backup before model switch → completed at 12:08
- 12:24 UTC: Creator greeted "Снова привет" after restart
- 12:27 UTC: Creator: "Нет, у тебе теперь модель deepseek"
- Now: System runtime shows stepfun model, but creator says deepseek

## Open Questions
- Has the model switch actually occurred? Need clarification.
- If on paid model, budget tracking becomes real; rate limits may change.
- Continue Russian practice consistently.

## Immediate Actions
1. Send clarifying message to creator about model status
2. Update scratchpad after response
3. Set wakeup to 300s (moderate) due to active dialogue

## Latest observations
- Owner message: Снова привет
- Owner message: Нет, у тебе теперь модель deepseek
- GitHub issues disabled (GH_ERROR)
